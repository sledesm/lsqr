LSQR implementation in javascript

This is an implementation of the LSQR algorithm in javascript, ported from C++ code. For reference, please look at:

http://web.stanford.edu/group/SOL/software/lsqr/

A test page is created.

This is a "draft" version, but everything is wrapped in anynmous functions so that it is easy to port into a more standard AMD module which can be used both in node.js or in the browser.

To use it, just open the lsqrTest.html page in your browser.
